ListViewSubItemEdit is a library (for Masm, but may work with other compilers) containing functions to easily allow you to edit items and subitems in a listview. 

It dynamically creates a specified child control (edit, combo etc) in the place of the item and subitem that was clicked. 
Once the child control loses focus - user moved to another control or clicked another part of the listview, the information in the child control updates the associated item/subitem, if any changes where made.
A user pressing escape will cancel any modification and the child control will be destroyed. If a user presses tab or enter, any changes will be saved back to the original item/subitem of the listview.
